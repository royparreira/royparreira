- 👋 Hi, I’m @royparreira - You can call me Roy!

- 👀 I’m a back-end engineer with Java as core language and Spring Boot as core framework, who I strongly believe and practice the philosophy that whoever coded should know how to build, deploy and maintain, therefore I love DevOps concepts.

- Passionate with Cloud Services and how fast it enables ideas to become products and how it make possible to developers also work with infrastructure.

- I'm a hudge fan of the best practices of Software Development and Software Architecture like Clean Code, Clean Arch, Hexagonal Arch, Domain Driven Design, SOLID and TDD.

- Also love scripts and automation and due my Engineering (Mechatronics) graduation I like to take some adventures in the embedded systems world  

- 🌱 I’m currently learning OAuth and Security Standards along with Observability and Traceability

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project written in Java or Go
