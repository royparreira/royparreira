- 👋 Hi, I’m @royparreira - You can call me Roy!

- 👀 I’m interested in technology in general! But I'm not a big fan of graphical interfaces so, I really like backend stuff, devops and cloud.
 
Also love scripts and automation and due my Engineering (Mechatronics) graduation I like to take some adventures in the embedded systems world  

- 🌱 I’m currently learning all!!! But specifically devops like, deployments strategies, kubernetes patterns ...

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project written in Java or Shell
